# Release

Releases are tag-driven and built with GoReleaser.

## Before Tagging

Run the local gate:

```sh
make release-check
```

Optionally build a local snapshot archive:

```sh
make snapshot
```

## Tagging

Use semantic version tags. Add a prerelease suffix only for prerelease builds:

```sh
git tag v0.2.0
git push origin v0.2.0
```

Pushing a `v*` tag runs `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which uses GoReleaser
to build Linux, macOS, and Windows binaries for amd64 and arm64. The CLI version
is injected with `-ldflags` into `internal/app.Version`.

The release workflow publishes `checksums.txt` with the GitHub release and then
generates GitHub artifact attestations from that checksum file using
`actions/attest`. The attestation binds every release archive named in
`checksums.txt` to the tag workflow that built it.

## Verifying a Release Asset

Download the archive and checksum file for the tag:

```sh
tag=v0.2.0
version="${tag#v}"
archive="codex-acp-adapter_${version}_linux_amd64.tar.gz"

gh release download "$tag" \
  --repo hecatehq/codex-acp-adapter \
  --pattern "$archive" \
  --pattern checksums.txt
```

Verify the checksum and provenance:

```sh
grep "  ${archive}$" checksums.txt | shasum -a 256 -c -
gh attestation verify "$archive" --repo hecatehq/codex-acp-adapter
```

Do not call a release stable until the current
[stable-readiness gate](STABLE_READINESS.md) is green.
