# Testing

This repository currently tests the adapter scaffold, not a complete Codex
runtime bridge.

## Covered Today

- CLI version output
- ACP `initialize` response shape
- request ID preservation
- malformed JSON errors without stopping later requests
- invalid JSON-RPC version errors
- notification dispatch without responses
- fake runtime method dispatch through the stdio transport
- fake runtime error propagation
- fake runtime session creation
- fake prompt lifecycle with assistant chunk, tool call, and tool update
  notifications emitted before the prompt response
- cancel notification and cancel request behavior
- session close and post-close not-found behavior
- scaffold `session/prompt` not-implemented errors
- 1 MiB inbound message cap
- hardened process runner behavior: fixed argv, shell rejection, absolute cwd
  enforcement, env allowlists, redaction, output caps, missing-binary errors,
  non-zero exits, and context cancellation
- long-lived process start behavior: stdin/stdout pipes, bounded stderr capture,
  process IDs, exit errors, shell rejection, and cancellation
- `doctor` runtime-boundary probe success, missing-binary, shell rejection,
  failed version-probe, secret redaction, and invalid-workdir behavior
- runtime launcher defaults, env/argv merging, bounded stderr, shell rejection,
  missing-workdir validation, exit errors, and cancellation
- runtime JSON-RPC client request/response matching, notifications, child
  events, error responses, malformed stdout failure, and request timeout
  cleanup
- ACP initialize negotiation over the runtime JSON-RPC client, including client
  info/capabilities, agent capability parsing, protocol-version mismatch, and
  runtime RPC error propagation
- ACP session lifecycle calls over the runtime JSON-RPC client: `session/new`,
  `session/prompt`, `session/cancel`, `session/close`, session updates, stop
  reasons, MCP server payloads, and RPC error propagation
- ACP server-to-runtime bridge behavior: handler param validation, session
  method proxying, prompt update forwarding, cancel notifications, close
  requests, and runtime RPC error mapping
- runtime host composition: subprocess launch, ACP initialize handshake,
  initialize result retention, bridge option exposure, prompt update forwarding,
  and protocol-version mismatch cleanup
- root ACP runtime flags: opt-in subprocess-backed serving, required absolute
  runtime workdir, runtime argv passthrough, and default scaffold behavior when
  no runtime binary is configured

## Not Covered Yet

These must be tested before Hecate switches from the current Codex ACP adapter to
this one:

- session load/resume/list
- prompt streaming with assistant chunks and terminal prompt results
- real cancellation and no double-settle behavior
- auth methods and auth-required errors
- model/config option discovery and updates
- permission modes
- shell, file, patch, web, MCP, image, plan, review, TODO, and goal tool
  mappings
- permission requests, late permission responses, and rejected/denied tools
- MCP server merging and MCP tool approval elicitations
- deterministic release binaries

## Test Strategy

Use `internal/acptest` for all protocol-level tests. It drives the real stdio
JSON-RPC path, so fake runtime tests exercise the same transport Hecate and
other ACP hosts will use.

Use `internal/process` for every subprocess boundary. Its tests pin the
security contract before real Codex integration lands. Use `Run` for bounded
one-shot probes and `Start` for long-lived runtime sessions that need stdio
pipes.

Use `internal/doctor` for local runtime readiness checks. Its tests use the Go
test binary as a fake Codex executable so command probing stays deterministic
and does not require a real Codex install.

Use `internal/runtimeproc` for the process-backed runtime boundary. It is the
only place that should decide the default Codex executable, allowed inherited
environment, and launch-time stdio process wiring.

Use `internal/runtimejsonrpc` for newline-delimited JSON-RPC over a launched
runtime process. It owns request IDs, pending response matching, child
notification delivery, and protocol decode failures; higher layers should keep
Codex-specific ACP mapping outside this transport client.

Use `internal/runtimeacp` for ACP protocol lifecycle calls made to a
subprocess-backed runtime. It should stay protocol-shaped and vendor-neutral;
Codex-specific behavior belongs in the layer that maps Codex runtime semantics
onto ACP.

Use `internal/runtimebridge` to connect ACP server handlers to a
subprocess-backed runtime client. It owns handler-level param decoding,
runtime-error mapping, and forwarding runtime `session/update` notifications
while a prompt request is active.

Use `internal/runtimehost` as the composition boundary for real runtime
sessions. It owns launching the subprocess-backed client, sending the ACP
`initialize` handshake with adapter identity/capabilities, retaining the
runtime's initialize result, exposing the bridge's ACP handler options, and
force-closing the child during cleanup.
